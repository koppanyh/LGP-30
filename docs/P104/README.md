# P104

P104 (program 10.4) is a tape loader program that will load a program into
memory using an almost assembly-like format.

The PDFs are the original German documentation. I used Gemma 3 as OCR to
transcribe them and then went through and fixed all the transcription errors
manually. Then ran that through Gemini 2.5 Pro for translation to English and
again manually fixed and corrected a few things.

The translation can be found [here](./translation.md).
