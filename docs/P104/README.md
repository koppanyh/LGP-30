# P104

P104 (program 10.4) is a tape loader program that will load a program into
memory using an almost assembly-like format.

The PDFs are the original German documentation. I used OCR to transcribe them
and then went through and fixed all the transcription errors manually. Then ran
that through Google Translate and again manually fixed and corrected a few
things.

The translation can be found [here](./translation.md).
